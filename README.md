# bgt_detectron
Small demo of detecting bgt objects using the detectron2 framework.
`test_detectron.ipynb` is a standalone demo taken from https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/
`train_model_coco.ipynb` is a demo script that learns to detects houseboats using a small dataset, the dataset download can be found in the releases section. 
A new dataset can be made using the cocotrainer qgis plugin https://github.com/jonathan-gerb/cocotrainer although I haven't written any documentation for this so you'll need some experience with qgis plugins.
